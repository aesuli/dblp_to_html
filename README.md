# dblp_to_html
Creates a custom HTML publication page for an author out of the dblp XML data.
Useful to include it in a personal website with static content.

The XML publications list for an author is accessible from a URL that has the form `https://dblp.org/pid/<author pid>.xml` (e.g., `74/4209` for me).
The link is accessible from the "export bibliography" menu on the right of the author name on the dblp page of the author.
